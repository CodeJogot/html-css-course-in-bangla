      During my university life, I used to solve competitive programming
      problems in various online judges such as UVa, CodeForces, TopCoder,
      HackerRank, GeeksforGeeks etc. Till now, I've solved more than 1300
      problems in these sites. Now-a-days, I spend most of the time in farming,
      travelling and developing my own projects and ideas.
